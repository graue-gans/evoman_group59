\section{Introduction}
Background: Motivation of EAs in game playing (EvoMan), optimization problems, explaining genetic operators (such as mutation and crossover?) \\

Crossover vs. Mutation: why are we manipulating Crossover instead of mutation? potential impact of crossover on convergence \\

Research Gap: why those specific crossover operators? keyterms: overfitting, convergence, leading to RQ \\

Research Question:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item What is the impact of BLEND and TWO-POINT crossover operators on the convergence and performance of an Evolutionary Algorithm in training a specialist agent in EvoMan?
 	\item maybe adding the term overfitting to the RQ? or only focus on convergence and mentioning overfitting in discussion
	\item Does BLEND crossover result in faster convergence than TWO-POINT crossover? Which operator helps the EA avoid local optima more effectively?
	\item we could have hypotheses related to overfitting and convergence behavior of the two operators
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}
explanation of the algorithms and operators: \\
comparing different crossover operators over EA, keeping the rest of the algorithm fixed
